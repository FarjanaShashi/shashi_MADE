## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
### The Impact of CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Sea Level Rise

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do rising CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions correlate with changes in mean sea levels?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change is one of the most important challenges of our time. One of the key factors responsible for this is increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. This increase is causing effects on mean sea levels around the world. This project uses historical data to analyze the correlation between atmospheric CO₂ levels and sea level rise. The analysis will employ statistical methods to establish the relationship between these variables.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Data on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Our World in Data

* Metadata URL: [https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e/explore](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-codebook.csv)
* Data URL: [https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/9c3764c0efcc4c71934ab3988f219e0e_0.csv](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/raw/master/owid-co2-data.csv)
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset presents the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, on a monthly and yearly basis, dating back to 1958.

### Datasource2: Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.

* Metadata URL: [https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855/explore](https://github.com/datasets/sea-level-rise/blob/master/data/epa-sea-level.csv)
* Data URL: [https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b84a7e25159b4c65ba62d3f82c605855_0.csv](https://github.com/datasets/sea-level-rise/raw/master/data/epa-sea-level.csv)
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset gives estimates of the rise of global sea levels, based on measurements from satellite radar altimeters.
