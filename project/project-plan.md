## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
### Impact of Climate Change on African Crop Production

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does climate change affect crop production in African farm households?
2. What measures can mitigate these effects?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Agricultural productivity is severely threatened by climate change, especially in sensitive areas like Africa. This project aims to analyze the impact of climate change on crop production in African farm households by examining changes in crop yields relative to climatic variables. Using two comprehensive datasets, I want to identify key patterns and correlations. The results will provide insights into how climate variability affects agricultural output. Also, explore potential adaptation strategies to enhance resilience against climate-related disruptions.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Crop Production & Climate Change

* Metadata URL: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-relationship-between-crop-production-and-cli>

* Data Type: CSV

This dataset includes information on various crop types and their production levels about climatic factors.

### Datasource2: Agricultural Survey of African Farm Households

* Metadata URL: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/agricultural-survey-of-african-farm-households>

* Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains survey data from African farm households.  It provides a comprehensive overview of farming conditions and outputs across different regions in Africa.
